Description

This project is an interactive map designed to visualize earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal is to provide an intuitive and accessible visualization of seismic activity and its relationship with tectonic plates.

Contents

index.html: The main HTML file that structures the map.
static/js/logic.js: JavaScript file containing functions to fetch data, build the map, and add interactive elements.
static/css/style.css: CSS file to style the map and ensure it fits the screen.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Usage
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Interact with the map by selecting different base maps and overlays using the layer control.

Features

Interactive Map: Displays earthquake data with markers that vary in size and color based on magnitude and depth.
Tectonic Plates Overlay: Shows the boundaries of tectonic plates to illustrate their relationship with seismic activity.
Layer Control: Allows users to switch between different base maps (Satellite, Grayscale, Outdoors) and toggle earthquake and tectonic plate data on and off.
Popups: Provides additional information about each earthquake, including its location, magnitude, and depth.
Legend: Displays a color-coded legend indicating the depth of earthquakes.
Example Usage
Open the index.html file in your browser. Use the layer control in the top right corner to switch between base maps and to toggle the visibility of the earthquake and tectonic plate layers. Click on earthquake markers to view detailed information about each event.
